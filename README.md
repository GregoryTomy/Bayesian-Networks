# Exploring Bayesian Networks: Replicating Causal Protein Signalling Study

This study replicates Sachs et al.’s (2005) “Causal Protein-Signaling Networks Derived from Multiparame- ter Single-Cell Data” using
Bayesian networks (BN). We explore the fundamental concepts of BNs, empha- sizing their role in causal inference. We successfully 
reconstructed the 17 arcs reported in the original paper using the Tabu search algorithm with MBDe score. Five false positives were 
identified in our analysis, indicat- ing potential overinclusiveness of the model. We discuss the implications of these findings and 
highlight the practical applications of BNs in unraveling causal relationships in complex biological systems. Additionally, we address 
the replication issues encountered during the project.
